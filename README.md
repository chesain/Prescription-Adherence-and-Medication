# Prescription-Adherence-and-Medication (PAM) - Database Final Project

# About
Problem Statement: The application I am designing will help care teams at hospitals better manage their patients’ medication by being able to monitor their patients’ medication adherence and medications. This will allow care team specialists to create and delete an existing patient's prescriptions, as well as check up on a patient's adherence to prescription.
